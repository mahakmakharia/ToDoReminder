PROJECT: ToDoReminder
BY: MAHAK MAKHARIA & AANISHA BHATTACHARYYA OF INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT, KOLKATA


WORKING:
ToDoReminder is a website which will solve our problem of forgetting things. For instance, you needed to buy something from a specific place but it is far away from your place of residence but the next time you visit the place you forget about buying the same. To solve this problem, what we do is remind you about the task. For receiving this reminder you will first have to sign up on the website and in your account you can maintain your to-do(s) list by entering the location of the place where you need to get something done and you can add the task you need to do at that location. Now, the next time you visit any place which is in 500 metre radius of the given location then by live- tracking your location we will push a reminder stating that you had to do this task here or nearby. The entire model is designed using firebase, for account authentication and maintaining the database, MapQuest API to for georevcoding and IP API to get the users current location.
